# Hardware

Most of the self hosted clusters used [nolte/ansible_playbook-baseline-online-server](https://github.com/nolte/ansible_playbook-baseline-online-server) and
[PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s) for the baseline installation. Not Required if you use `k8s as a Service` or something like `kind` or  `talos`.
