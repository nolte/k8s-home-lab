## Application Structure

<!--structure-description-start-->
We try to find a Reuseable folder structure, for handle different kindes of Services, with the same tooling.

| `configuration` | This Structure will be contains all required Scripts for Configure and Bootstrap the Service. Mostly use Terraform/Terragrount Scripts, executed as Post Deployment Hook with [Argo Workflow](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/). |
| `deploy`        | Subdirectory with Deployment Relevant Structures/Elements.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `deploy/argocd` | A [kustomization](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) Project for bring the Application to a Cluster, used ArgoCD as Deployment Tool.                                                                                        |
